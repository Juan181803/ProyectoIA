# Video Annotation System Using Pose Detection and Activity Classification

## Abstract
This project implements a real-time video annotation system capable of detecting and classifying specific human activities using pose estimation and machine learning. The system utilizes MediaPipe for pose detection and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for activity classification, achieving an overall accuracy of 95.4%. The solution can detect and classify activities such as walking, turning, sitting, and standing, while also tracking key joint movements and postural changes in real-time.

## Introduction
Human activity recognition through video analysis has become increasingly important in various fields, including healthcare, sports analysis, and human-computer interaction. Our project addresses the challenge of automatically detecting and classifying human activities while providing real-time postural analysis.

### Problem Statement
The main objective is to develop a software tool that can:
- Analyze specific human activities in real-time
- Track joint movements and postural changes
- Provide accurate classification of activities
- Measure key postural metrics (lateral inclination, joint angles)

## Theory
The system architecture combines several key technologies and concepts:

### Pose Estimation
We utilize MediaPipe's pose detection solution, which provides 33 body landmarks in 3D space. These landmarks serve as the foundation for our feature extraction process.

### Feature Engineering
Key features extracted include:
- Joint angles (knee flexion, hip angles)
- Postural metrics (torso verticality, shoulder rotation)
- Movement characteristics (lateral sway, arm swing)
- Spatial relationships between joints

### Classification Model
We implemented an SVM classifier with RBF kernel, chosen for its effectiveness in handling non-linear relationships and its robust performance with high-dimensional data.

## Methodology
Our approach followed the CRISP-DM methodology:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Recorded videos of multiple subjects performing various activities, such as walking, turning, sitting, and standing, from different angles and perspectives.
   - Created a comprehensive dataset covering different movement variations and body postures.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Landmark extraction was performed using MediaPipe to capture the 33 key points for each frame.
   - Applied the Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth the extracted data, reducing noise caused by fluctuations in the pose landmarks.
   - Normalized and standardized the feature vectors to ensure that all features had equal importance during model training.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Generated 111 features including:
     - Joint angles and distances
     - Movement patterns
     - Postural indicators

4. **Model Development**
   - Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets to ensure the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data.
   - Implemented the SVM classifier with a C value of 10 and an RBF kernel.
   - Applied 10-fold cross-validation to validate the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.

5. **Real-time Implementation**
   - Developed a frame-by-frame processing pipeline for real-time analysis of video input.
   - Implemented a confidence scoring system that evaluated the certainty of the modelâ€™s predictions for each frame.
   - Created a real-time visualization interface to display the recognized activities and postural metrics for user feedback.

## Results
The system achieved impressive performance metrics:

```

Overall Accuracy: 95.4%

### Key Achievements

- Real-time processing capability (30+ FPS)
- Robust activity classification
- Accurate joint angle measurements
- Effective postural analysis

### Results Analysis

The system shows exceptional performance in detecting dynamic activities (walking, turning) with perfect precision and recall. Static postures (standing, sitting) show slightly lower but still robust performance (>90% precision), likely due to subtle variations in posture that can create classification challenges.
The implementation of movement verification helps prevent misclassifications, though it occasionally leads to conservative predictions for low-movement activities.

### Future Work and Improvements

While the system performed exceptionally well, there are several areas for future development:

- **Temporal Modeling**: Incorporating temporal models, such as LSTM or GRU, could enhance the system's ability to recognize complex movement patterns over time, improving its performance with activities involving continuous motion or changes in posture.
- **Expanded Activity Set**: The system could be extended to recognize more complex activities, such as running, squatting, or other dynamic movements, to make the system more versatile.
- **Confidence Scoring**: A more sophisticated confidence scoring system could be developed to help the system make more reliable predictions in ambiguous situations.
- **User Interface**: Integrating the system with a user-friendly graphical interface could make it suitable for clinical or sports applications, enabling professionals to visualize real-time data easily.

### Conclusions

The developed system successfully meets its primary objectives, providing accurate activity classification and postural analysis in real-time. The system's overall accuracy of 95.4% demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting dynamic and static activities. However, future improvements could include the implementation of temporal modeling for better sequence understanding, the extension of the activity set, and the development of a more advanced confidence scoring system.

This work lays the groundwork for applications in healthcare, sports, and human-computer interaction. The real-time processing capability, along with robust classification and postural analysis, makes this system an effective tool for a variety of use cases, including rehabilitation and performance optimization.
